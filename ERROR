cd trip
gmake check

The tests should pass, but gmake check doesn't pass them. How should I fix this?

2.
gmake

java make.Main -f makefile1.tst -D fileinfo1.tst "T1"

java make.Main -f makefile4.tst -D fileinfo4.tst "A B C"

java make.Main -f makefile8.tst -D fileinfo8.tst "T1"
 
java make.Main -f makefile9.tst -D fileinfo9.tst "T1"

These correspond to tests 1, 4, 8, and 9 on the autograder, and for some reason, the
output I get from testing these do not match the ones I get back from the autograder.
What could be wrong, and how should I fix it?  All of these tests pass correctly when
I run them on ssh from my laptop.
